                Personal injury calculator (&quot;PIC&quot;) is an estimate of the value of a given personal
                injury matter. It is not a guarantee that if you retain Browne Law Group that your
                case will have the exact or approximate value displayed by this PIC. The PIC also
                does not consider whether the bad actor that injured you has insurance, funds, or
                the means to pay the estimate provided by the PIC. There are a myriad intangible
                factors such as credibility, presentation, criminal history, number of family members,
                closeness of relatives, criminal history, age, gender and other nuanced factors that
                play into value that cannot be electronically factored in to the PIC.
